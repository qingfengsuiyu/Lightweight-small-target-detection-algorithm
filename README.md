# Lightweight-small-target-detection-algorithm
Original Code of the Lightweight Small Target Detection Algorithm Based on YOLOv8 Network Improvement

# Usage Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up and run the code.

### 1. Download and Extract the ZIP File
First, download the ZIP file of the repository. After downloading, extract the contents to a directory of your choice.

### 2. Download YOLOv8n Pre-trained Weights
Next, download the original YOLOv8n pre-trained weights file. Place this weight file in the same directory where the extracted code is located.

### 3. Download the VisDrone Dataset
Download the VisDrone dataset and place it in the same directory as the YOLOv8n weight file.

### 4. Run the Training Script
Finally, navigate to the directory where you have placed all the necessary files and execute the following command to start the training:

```bash
python test.py
```

This will start the training process. Ensure that your environment is set up with the necessary dependencies before running the script.

---

Make sure to replace `test.py` with the actual name of your script if it's different, and feel free to add any further details (like dependencies) if needed!

This version includes the clarification that the experimental results mentioned in the paper are also included in the ZIP file.
